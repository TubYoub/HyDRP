## Getting Started

At first you have to download and unzip the  ```HyDRP-0.2.1.zip```.
<br> And you have to aktivate the API in your Hypixel settings.
1. When you run the HyDRP.exe for the Firsttime you will be asked to put in your Minecraft Username and your API key fom Hypixel.
<br>(You can get your API key by typing ```/api new``` into the [Hypixel](https://hypixel.net/) Chat)
2. When your API key and MC Username is valid the sript will print that to the console.
3. The sript will begin to check if u are online and when the account is online it search for ur last game on Hypixel.
